 <p> PROG31975 Project - Akshay, Luke, Ammar </p>


<h1> APP INTRODUCTION </h1>

<p> Are you and your friends indecisive? Do you struggle to decide where to go out for drinks? Bar roulette is an app that let’s destiny decide where you’re going out tonight.  Our app randomly selects a location from a list of nearby bars for you.  Information about the bar is then displayed and you are then able to redirect to uber or google maps.  If you end up liking the location, you can add it to a list of favorites for later use! </p>

<p> The target audience for this app is anyone of legal drinking age but mostly people in their 20-30s as they tend to be a little more adventurous than the older crowd. Not to mention that this app is intended for alcohol drinkers alongside those who like to go out and be social. </p>

<p> The problem that bar roulette is attempting to solve is the issue of not being able to decide where to grab a drink. This idea is tackled through the use of random chance to tell the user of the application where their next round of drinks is to be served.  Not to mention the app also lets you mark down bars as favourites and keeps them ready and waiting in a list for you to view later.  Essentially bar roulette is a means to discover and save your favourite bar all in a simple and easy-to-use app for your iPhone. </p>

<p> For specifically getting a hold of the potential bars that will be shown to the user, we will make use of location services available to us within the iOS environment to source local pubs. When presenting the bar to the user we will make use of app clips to open the bar in other apps such as Apple Maps. Following all of this, the favourites functionality as mentioned before will be tackled using data persistence to keep the list the same throughout multiple sessions. </p>

<h1> WORK DISTRIBUTION </h1>

<p> The various functionalities the app will have is a favorites section of bars view using data persistence, where users will have their saved bars on the page so they don’t have to take time to search up the bar again. Along with this, there will be an Apple Maps page where users can check how far or close proximity bars are to them. After a long night at the bar, it is preferred that a person to not drive than rather to call an uber to get a ride home. For this part of the app, Akshay will be responsible. </p>

<p> For the UI and UX part of the app where the “Bar Roulette” is designed for a user-friendly experience, while also it will be easy to navigate to different views and pages of the app. Along with this, there will be randomization of selection of bars where it uses a list of bars and picks one bar at random every time the user uses the app to go out drinking with their family and friends. This part of the app, Luke will be responsible for. </p>

<p> Lastly, for the fetching list part of the app, it uses location services to show and find nearby bars where it is close to the user’s location radius. Along with this, the interaction of views will be made sure to be user-friendly of how well and quickly it is to navigate through the app. This part of the app Ammar will be responsible for. </p>
